The project activity by Gangamai Industries & Constructions Ltd involves setting up an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) within the sugar factory in Shevgaon, Maharashtra. The recycled effluent will be reused by the project activity for gardening and irrigation, which would otherwise have been met by groundwater extraction from the existing bore wells. Hence, supporting the broader goals of water conservation and environmental stewardship.

Address of Project Activity Najik Babhulgaon, Post: Rakshi, Tal-Shevgaon, Dist:
Ahmednagar, Gujarat.

Lat. & Longitude 19°22' 47.28" N
75°17'00.72" E

Type and Scope of RoU Project Activity: 
Type Scope 5: Conservation measures taken to recycle and/or
reuse water, spent wash, wastewater etc. across or within specific
industrial processes and systems, including wastewater recycled/
reused in a different process, but within the same site or location
of the project activity. Recycled wastewater used in off-site
landscaping, gardening or tree plantations/forests activity are also
eligible under this Scope.

The project activity recycles wastewater from the Sugar Factory
within the defined project boundary and reuses the treated water
for Gardening, and Irrigation. The project activity showcases
efficient reuse of industrial wastewater as a key corporate
environmental intervention towards achieving more water security
in that region.

________________
PP has installed 1MLD Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) on 10 Dec’2013 to treat and recycle the
wastewater generated from the production process. By treating and reusing wastewater, the
company can contribute to environmental conservation and reduce soil contamination.
The sugar industry generates a significant amount of wastewater from various stages of
production process, which contains high levels of pollutants such as organic matter, suspended
solids, and various chemicals. The process includes water used for cane washing, which cleans
the sugarcane before processing, and juice extraction, where water is utilized in the milling
process to extract juice from the cane. During boiling and crystallization, water is employed to
concentrate the juice and form sugar crystals. Additionally, water is used in cooling and
condensing to cool and condense vapours during the boiling process. Finally, cleaning and
maintenance activities within the factory premises also contribute to wastewater generation, as
water is used to clean equipment and maintain hygiene standards.

If the wastewater is released into the environment without proper treatment, it can cause severe
pollution, affecting aquatic life, soil quality, and human health.
Therefore, this project activity helps reduce the environmental impact by treating wastewater and
utilizing it for Gardening and agricultural purposes such as Irrigation, further promoting
sustainability.
